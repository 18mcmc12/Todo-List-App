A to-do list is a list of tasks you need to complete or things that you want to do and in our design [Todo List App], at first, there is a content-box that holds only the input field with some buttons and text. When you entered some characters and click on the plus (+) button, the list will be added to your tasks list and the number of the pending tasks also updated. You can also delete each list by clicking on the trash icon, and remember this trash icon only appear on hover on the particular list and you can also delete all task with a single click.
